---
We recommend installing the complete Anaconda python distribution. Intel python
distributions also is recommendable. Follow instructions accordingly to

-[Anacnda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

-[oneAPI AI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit-download.html)

## $\LaTeX$ , JabRef, GitHub

We'll also need a complete installation of $\LaTeX$ --see for example the
TexLive distribution

-[TexLive](https://tug.org/texlive/).

-[JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/) Is a good bibliogrphy tool to manage bibtex
databases.

Because an important component of this course is a project installed on Git
repository we recommend take any tutorial about this now mandatory topic. You
can use mercury bitbucket or GitHub. In this course we will give examples for
GitHub.

## IDEs: pycharm, vscode, rstudio

If you want to produce professional code, then use professional tools. We will
use pycharm as principal IDE to code python. Follow the installation tutorial
from
[pycharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

## working in the cloud: colab, binder, AWS
